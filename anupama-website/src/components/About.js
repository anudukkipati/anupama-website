               Hello, My Name is <strong>Anupama Gadde</strong>. Welcome to My Website. I am a <strong>Full-Stack Web Developer</strong> with a passion for learning.
            </p>
            <p>
            I come from a healthcare background and decided to change my career to pursue Web Development.
            </p>

            My interest in Web Development was sparked many years ago, when an acquaintance of mine was looking for someone to build a basic website for his startup company in India. He wanted a website with features such as, a description for his company and link for prospective employees to submit their resumes. He wanted the resumes that were submitted to be stored in a database. This is how my adventures began in the world of Web Development. I used the resources available on world wide web, for HTML & CSS and used the book (PHP, Apache, MySQL) provided my acquaintance to build the website. The website I built was basic and met the requirements that my acquaintance requested. I built the website without styling (as my acquaintance did not care for design aspect), however the website served its purpose.

            Although my interest in Web Development was sparked long ago, I didnâ€™t think of pursuing Web Development until recently. In 2019, I decided to purchase a Web Development course on Udemy (The Complete Web Developer Bootcamp by Colt Steele). After finishing the course, I thought it was time I invest in another Bootcamp to build a strong foundation (and that offers career services). Now that I have graduated from Flatiron School (Software Engineering Track), I am ready to go on a new quest as a Full-Stack Web Developer.
